## üöÄ Deployment

The application is deployed using a modern, decoupled approach:

* **Backend API:** Deployed as a **Web Service** on [**Render**](https://render.com/). Render automatically deploys new versions upon pushes to the `main` branch.
* **Frontend Application:** Deployed as a **Static Site** on [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/). Netlify is connected to the same GitHub repository and deploys the `frontend` directory.

This architecture ensures high availability, scalability, and a clear separation of concerns between the client and server.
